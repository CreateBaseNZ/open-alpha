          with your group and see how many you can list down in your learning

          quad-bikes and airplanes.

          Pick three of the robots/vehicles that you identified in task 1. For
          each of them, what types of goods does this device normally deliver?
          Can you think of any other goods that it could be used for (that it is
          currently not being used to deliver)? Discuss with your group and
          write your answers in your learning journals.

          Out of the same three devices, which does your team think would be
          best at delivering mail to peopleâ€™s letterboxes in a suburban
          environment? Discuss with a team and make sure that you agree on an
          answer. Justify your answer by listing the pros and cons of each
          device in your learning journals.

              What design features, like sensors, transportation mode and shape,

              deliver mail to letterboxes 100 metres under water?

          Broadly speaking, artificial intelligence (AI) is all about creating
          programs and machines that are able to carry out human behaviours like
          critical thinking and decision making. Generally, the realism of an AI
          is judged by how closely it acts like a human. AI can be as simple as
          an automatic light switch or as complicated as an autocorrect in a
          text document. As a group, see how many different pieces of technology
          you can think of that utilise AI. List them all in your learning
          journals.

          What do you think are the pros and cons of driving a delivery van
          using a person compared to an AI? Things that you could consider
          include costs of operating the van, the required size of the van,
          driving efficiency, emergency situations like accidents. Discuss as a
          group and list all of the pros and cons you can think of for humans
          and AI in your learning journals.

          If a human driving a delivery van crashes into a house, who is
          responsible for the damage? Discuss as a group until you agree on an
          answer and then write it into your learning journals. Make sure that
          you justify your answers.

        <li>
          If a robot driving a delivery van crashes into a house, who is
          responsible for the damage? The robot (it only did what it was
          programmed to do)? The programmer? The company who sold the robot? Or
          someone/something else? Discuss as a group until you agree on an
          answer and then write it into your learning journals. Make sure that
          you justify your answers.
        </li>
        <li>
          If we replace a delivery driver with a robot, what happens to the
          driver? They will lose their job and their income. Is this trade worth
          it if it improves delivery times? Explain why or why not by first
          discussing as a group and then writing an answer in your learning
          journals.

        <li>
          How could the government support this person who has lost their job
          because they were replaced by a robot? Discuss as a group and then

      <ol>
        <li>
          A train is moving down the tracks and is going to run over five
          people! You have a lever that you could pull to send the train down
          another track, which would result in it only running over one person.
          Would you pull the lever? Discuss as a group and then write your
          answers in your learning journals. Make sure that you explain why you
          made your decision.

          is about how closely it acts like a human. AI can be as simple as an
          automatic light switch or as complicated as a self-driving car. As AI
          becomes really common, there will eventually be a situation where an
          AI needs to decide between two or more groups of people to harm. How
          do you think AI should make decisions where every possible action
          would cause some harm to humans? What variables will they need to take
          into account? For example, should a self-driving car value the safety
          of the people in the car more or less than potential victims outside
          the car?
