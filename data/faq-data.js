All other tasks can be completed in the lesson as per the lesson plan or as homework activities. If an individual student needs additional help or guidance, you can ask them to temporarily share their screen (potentially in a breakout room) so that you can see what they are doing and guide them more closely.",
          "If your school is not running regular lessons or has poor turnout, then you can instead skip over the class discussion parts of the lesson plans and assign students individual tasks (e.g. complete the Research step by DD/MM/YYYY). We recommend you use the learning journal to set completion targets for your class and have them share with you their progress by making their learning journals available to you through email or google classroom."],

          "Flow coding is designed to be easy to learn for teachers and students, being analogous to creating a logic-based flowchart. This is because we want the coding section of each Project to be based around learning logical thinking, information flow, computational skills, and problem-solving, without the need for memorising lots of arbitrary syntaxes.",

If you do not want your students to complete a learning journal or you want to replace them with your own, then you are free to do so. If you are going to do either of these, then make sure that you communicate it clearly to your class. We would also appreciate you sending us a message explaining why you are skipping them so that we can improve our product."],

If you prefer class discussions, you may decide you want your students to do all the class discussion activities and even add some of your own. Instead, you may want to be hands-off and skip over class discussions and get your students to complete tasks on the platform as much as possible. There is no correct approach; teach as you please.
